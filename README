This code is not mine own.

First the style transfer code is a copy from [1] tch-rs. The maintainer has been an amazing
help to me getting going and answering lots of questions. I tweaked the code to take a path for
the styles. I also catch panics and move on. If it panics most likely do not enough cuda memory.

Second after much reading about two thoughts on keeping the color during style transfer I found
kmeans_colors. Kmeans provides a bin that can do a color transfer. I ripped that up in two a few
functions. [2]


I added opts
```
style_transfer 0.1.0

USAGE:
    style_transfer [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] --source <source> --style <style> --vgg <vgg>

FLAGS:
    -d, --debug
    -h, --help         Prints help information
    -k, --keepcolor
    -V, --version      Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --colordepth <color-depth>     [default: 40]
    -r, --runs <runs>                  [default: 1500]
        --source <source>
        --style <style>
        --depth <style-depth>          [default: 2]
        --vgg <vgg>
```
depth does not work currently.

colordepth is how many colors to use in the color transfer.

code needs to be setup per [1] but vgg files are downloaded from:

https://github.com/LaurentMazare/ocaml-torch/releases/download/v0.1-unstable/vgg16.ot


style can be a file or a folder of images. if its a folder i run each file as the style. I like the way smaller style files look. see EXAMPLES
